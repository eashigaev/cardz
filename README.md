# Backend API for a demo-application "Cardz"

A demo-backend API for an imaginary mobile application or PWA. There are two main features - management and customer area.

## Features

- Scenario A: A cafe launches a bonus program "Buy 5 cups of coffee and get one cup for free". The cafe issues a virtual cards, notes the purchased cups and issues a bonus when the required number of cups is reached by any cardholder.
- Scenario B: A restaurant makes a loyalty program "Buy any 3 dishes from the list and get a discount." The restaurant issues virtual cards, notes the purchased dishes and gives the discount when the conditions of the promotion are completed by any cardholder.

Identification of customers and cards should be implemented on the frontend (QR-codes).

### A company can:

- make loyalty programs
- issue program-related cards to customers
- manage data
- check achievements and reward cards

TODO: company team (now owner only)

### A customer can:

- view own cards and achievements

### A program is:

- a set of tasks
- each task can be repeated or not
- specified achievements amount for reward

## Details

The main idea was to combine usefull approaches of enterprise application development (can be used with any object-oriented web-framework) with power Laravel capabilities.

- Modular structure with shared database (for simplicity)
- Layered module architecture - Infrastructure, Application, Domain (framework ignorance, optional)
- Detached API module - Backend For Frontend
- Simple CQRS read-side - Eloquent models, transformers
- DDD tactical patterns - aggregates, value objects and repositories, strategical patterns - the language, contexts


- Custom shared library for rapid development with Laravel
- Custom Authorization over default Gates - primitive ABAC
- A lot of Laravel features used - custom relation type, 

## Testing

- With test development
- Custom testing DSL - traits, methods, assertions
- Feature tests for main functionality, unit tests for complex specifications

## Installation

Installation and test running are the same for any Laravel application (official documentation)

## Requirements

PHP 8.1, PostgreSQL

## About Laravel

Laravel is a web application framework with expressive, elegant syntax. We believe development must be an enjoyable and
creative experience to be truly fulfilling. Laravel takes the pain out of development by easing common tasks used in
many web projects, such as:

- [Simple, fast routing engine](https://laravel.com/docs/routing).
- [Powerful dependency injection container](https://laravel.com/docs/container).
- Multiple back-ends for [session](https://laravel.com/docs/session) and [cache](https://laravel.com/docs/cache)
  storage.
- Expressive, intuitive [database ORM](https://laravel.com/docs/eloquent).
- Database agnostic [schema migrations](https://laravel.com/docs/migrations).
- [Robust background job processing](https://laravel.com/docs/queues).
- [Real-time event broadcasting](https://laravel.com/docs/broadcasting).

Laravel is accessible, powerful, and provides tools required for large, robust applications.
